Scenario 
<br>
Charles is a software development manager at a large financial institution. His group develops banking software using the client/server model. 
<br>
He was notified by the Security Operations that their SIEM tool alerted them about a "half-open denial of service attack" from the systems that run the same banking software. 
<br>
The software uses legacy remote procedure calls that allowed the masquerading attacks. It was later discovered that the portion of the software that uses distributed computing is outdated with open vulnerabilities. 
<br>
What must Charle's team implement to stop the masquerading attacks? <br><br>
