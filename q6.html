<h1>Q6 of 19</h1>

<form action="q7.html">

For some organization, an AWS DevOps Engineer set up an Elastic Load Balancer with Autoscaling on. Because of some manual errors made by the development team an instance of the balancer just rebooted and failed the autoscaling health check. Autoscaling marks it as unhealthy and initiates the removal process from the load balancer. The DevOps Engineer is monitoring the situation and would like to prevent the instance from getting terminated. What could the DevOps engineer do?  <br><br>

<b>Options</b> <br><br>
<input type="radio" name="n1"> 1. Using Autoscaling commands, update the instance status to healthy <br>
<input type="radio" name="n1"> 2. Change Autoscaling configurations to ignore the reboot events <br>
<input type="radio" name="n1"> 3. The instance will get terminated anyway. Nothing can prevent the termination once it was marked as unhealthy <br>
<input type="radio" name="n1"> 4.Add an instance manually to the autoscaling group <br><br>
